Not only does the engineer not have the correct tools for replicator setup (at least, judging from how the engineer is struggling with a job he clearly knows how to otherwise do), the ones he's jury-rigged from materials scrounged from the surrounding markets are so inefficient that the data-probe he's using has been diagnosing some kind of data stream interactions (the rest of the information is blocked by the engineer's hunched-over body) has taken a full hour to complete. Even you, an amateur engineer with experience gained from spaceship repair work on New Boston, know a good data-probe would've been done in a quarter of the time!`

My name is Franklin Fargass, and I represent Poseidon Industries' engineering team in this matter."

			`Lt. Sanders lifts an old-fashioned audio recorder from his pocket and shows it to Franklin. Lt. Sanders then replies, "I'm sorry to see Posideon Industries is not interested in helping the Republic do the job it set out to do." Franklin's expression turns to shock with a hint of panic.`
			`"I'm afraid I'll have to report you to General Seymour South, the commanding officer for this humanitarian effort," the Lieutennant says with a smile. "He will be most intersted to hear Posideon Industries has assigned a lawyer to do an engineer's job." Franklin, having re-gained his composure, casually retorts with a tone and look of amusement. "You know audio is only half the picture. You'll never be able to convince Gen. South with an obsolete bit of tech. Too easy to hack."`
			`"Perhaps not," Lt. Sanders replies, "but it is better than no evidence at all."`

All that gas leaked into the nearby ecosystems, killing off much of the local wildlife. So no, you didn't 'save' the locals."
